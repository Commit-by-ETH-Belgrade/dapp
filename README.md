**Check out smart contracts repo and backend repo too: https://github.com/orgs/Commit-by-ETH-Belgrade/repositories**

# Commit
Commit is na event platform, like [Luma](https://lu.ma/home) but with staking as an application mechanism for events. If you show up at the event, your stake is returned. No show up, no stake back. No more 1400 applications and 10 attendees. <b>Slashed stakes are redirected to funding public goods :)</b>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
